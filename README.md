# Evernote Memory
This is an iOS App that will display notes to the user on a schedule that will reinforce memorization.

Perhaps you can suggest a better name for it, I know there is one, I just haven't thought of it yet.

This is part of my 12-week, 0-App store challenge that's I'm chronicling at my site [Learn to be a Developer](http://learntobeadeveloper.com).
